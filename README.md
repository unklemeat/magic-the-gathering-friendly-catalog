I've created a comprehensive README for your MTG Friendly Catalog application. The README covers all the major features I identified in your HTML file, including:
Key sections included:

Overview of all features (search, collection management, deck building, etc.)
Technical stack information
Setup and configuration instructions
Usage guide for different functionalities
Troubleshooting section for common issues
Browser compatibility information

Notable features highlighted:

Voice search capability
Real-time Scryfall API integration
Multi-language support (Italian/English)
Firebase integration for data persistence
CSV import functionality
Responsive design
Advanced filtering and sorting

The README is structured to be informative for both users wanting to understand the application's capabilities and developers who might want to set it up or contribute to it. It includes proper technical details while remaining accessible to non-technical users who just want to manage their MTG collection
